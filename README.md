# Task 01 - Population Distribution Visualization

Internship: Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology  
Intern: Ishika Arora  

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task is to create **bar charts** and **histograms** to visualize the distribution of population using the **World Bank dataset (SP.POP.TOTL)**.  

## 📂 Dataset
Source: [World Bank – Total Population (SP.POP.TOTL)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)  
File Used: `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2.csv`  
Data contains **total population by country** from 1960 to 2022.  

## ⚙️ Approach
1. Imported the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Selected **year 2022** population data for analysis.  
3. Created:
   - **Bar Chart** → Top 10 most populated countries.  
   - **Histogram** → Distribution of populations across all countries.  


## 📊 Results
### Bar Chart – Top 10 Most Populated Countries in 2022
Bar Chart

### Histogram – Population Distribution Across Countries (2022)
Histogram

## 📝 Learnings
Learned to work with **World Bank open datasets**.  
Practiced **data cleaning and filtering** with Pandas.  
Understood when to use **Bar Charts (categorical comparison)** vs **Histograms (distribution analysis)**.  
Improved skills in **Matplotlib** and **data storytelling**.
